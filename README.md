# Python_Assignment

Q.1 Demonstrating OOP Concepts in Python
Objective:
Create a Python program that demonstrates inheritance, polymorphism, and the use of global, module, object, and local variables using real-world classes.
Instructions:
Inheritance and Polymorphism:
Create a base class Vehicle with a method start_engine that prints "Engine started."
Create a derived class Car that inherits from Vehicle and overrides the start_engine method to print "Car engine started."
Create another derived class Bike that inherits from Vehicle and overrides the start_engine method to print "Bike engine started."
Global Variable:
Define a global variable traffic_light with the value "Green".
Module Variable:
Define a module-level variable speed_limit with the value 60.
Object Variable:
In the Car class, define an object variable make that stores the make of the car.
In the Bike class, define an object variable type that stores the type of bike.
Local Variable:
In each start_engine method, define a local variable message that stores the respective message to be printed.








Explanation:

1) Global Variable:
traffic_light is defined outside of any function or class, making it a global variable accessible throughout the module.

2) Module-level Variable:
speed_limit is defined at the module level, accessible within the module.

3) Inheritance and Polymorphism:
Vehicle is the base class with a method start_engine.
Car and Bike are derived classes inheriting from Vehicle and overriding the start_engine method.

4) Object Variables:
In the Car class, make stores the make of the car.
In the Bike class, type stores the type of the bike.

5) Local Variables:
In each start_engine method, message is a local variable storing the message to be printed.
